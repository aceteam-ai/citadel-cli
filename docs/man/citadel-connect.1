.SH NAME
citadel-connect - Connect to a service on another node


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcitadel connect [peer:port] [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
Establishes a raw TCP connection to a service on another node and pipes
stdin/stdout to it.

.PP
This is useful for:
  - Testing connectivity to services
  - Piping data through the network
  - Using as SSH ProxyCommand (used internally by 'citadel ssh')

.PP
PEER IDENTIFICATION:
  You can specify the peer in multiple ways:
  - By hostname:  citadel connect gpu-node-1:5432
  - By IP:        citadel connect 100.64.0.25:5432
  - Interactive:  citadel connect  (prompts for peer and port)

The connection uses the tsnet userspace network, so it can reach peers
that system networking cannot.
